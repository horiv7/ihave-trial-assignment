The problem was that I didn't have a nice example page before.
This case would allow me to demonstrate my experience with UI Design.
I received a job application task from a colleague who was applying to an IT company.

This [UI design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cc089ff2-1c63-4827-a6fb-814127340eb0-995b/specs/) was supposed to be turned into static code.

The website was built with HTML and CSS using the SASS preprocessor. I was trying to be precise.
That's why I had a lot of media queries.

This is the first live version.
